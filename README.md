# What is Kong OIDC plugin

**kong-oidc** is a plugin for [Kong](https://github.com/Mashape/kong) implementing the
[OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) Relying Party (RP) functionality.

It authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider using 
[OpenID Connect Discovery](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)
and the Basic Client Profile (i.e. the Authorization Code flow).

It maintains sessions for authenticated users by leveraging `lua-resty-openidc` thus offering
a configurable choice between storing the session state in a client-side browser cookie or use
in of the server-side storage mechanisms `shared-memory|memcache|redis`.

It supports server-wide caching of resolved Discovery documents and validated Access Tokens.

It can be used as a reverse proxy terminating OAuth/OpenID Connect in front of an origin server so that
the origin server/services can be protected with the relevant standards without implementing those on
the server itself.

Introspection functionality add capability for already authenticated users and/or applications that
already posses acces token to go through kong. The actual token verification is then done by Resource Server.
